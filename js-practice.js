//Complete the instructions for each numbered problem 

//1. data types built-in methods, variables 

//a. define a variable and give it a string value

const name = "Luis Molinuevo";

//b. define a variable and give it a number value

let age = 14;

//c. define a variable and give it a boolean value

let empty = true;

//2. if else, ternary 
//a. define a variable 'metrocard' and give it a value of 5

const metrocard = 5

//b. write an if statement that has a condition to check if the value of metro card is greater than 2.75, and display the message "you have enough to ride the train", if the condition is true

if(metrocard >= 2.75) {
    console.log("you have enough to ride the train");
}

//c.write an else statement that displays the message "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"

else {
    console.log("you do not have enough to pay fare sorry")
}

//d. write the above if/else statement again as a ternary 

const ride = metrocard >= 2.75 ? "you have enough to ride the train" : "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"

//3. conditionals 2 (1 pt)
//a.  complete this codecademy project: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/magic-eight-ball-1 
//add a screenshot showing your completion of this project to the root folder of this repo

//4. functions 
//a. write a function named helloWorld that returns the value 'Hello World!' 

//b. console log the value returned from running the function helloWorld


//3. arrays
//a. define a variable myArray and assign it to a value of an array. Give the array at least 5 elements

//b. an array's index starts at:
//


//4. loops 
//a. write a for loop that console logs even numbers starting at 10 and decrementing to 0 


//5. objects
//a. define a variable named 'bike' 

//b. assign an object to bike 

//c. give the object 3 properties: handlebars, color, wheels 

//d. give each property a value 

//6. Chessboard
/*Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
